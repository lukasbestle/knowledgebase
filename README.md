# KnowledgeBase.php [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vis7mac/knowledgebase.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vis7mac/knowledgebase)

> An object storage producing *real* speaking code implemented in PHP.

You ever wanted to put some stuff in a cool object in PHP?
You already can, I hear you say. No, this one is cooler!

## Try it

You can find a demo file with a lot of comments in this repo called `demo.php` with all stuff `KnowledgeBase.php` can do at the moment.

You can run automated tests using [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de):
Simply run

	$ phpunit

from the root directory of the repo.

Have fun!

## What the fuck?! Why did you code that?

There are some simple reasons why I did that as an four-hour project. Here they are:

1. There are some languages like Prolog or SQL doing exactly that: Offering a way to parse spoken words as valid code. Why not offer such a way for objects in PHP? :)
3. Some people always say "Let your code and variable names speak so someone can understand it!". Here you go!
4. I wanted to make more cool stuff using jQuery-like query stuff. Actually inspired by [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) - it has exactly that for all objects making working with it easier and cooler. So that was a learning project for me.
5. It is cool. Period.

## Can I use that for production?

Yeah, you can. If you really want to use it.

It does not seem to have bugs, but do you really need it?
Maybe use a simpler structure :).

## Help me making it better!

As I already said: It is a learning project.
So if you know a better way to implement that features, let me know on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/vis7mac) or create a Pull Request!

Thanks a lot!
